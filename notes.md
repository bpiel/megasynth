Here is a description of desired functionality for a clojure namespace that I would like you to generate:

# 🎛️ Megasynth: Graph-Based Polyphonic Modular Synth System (Full Spec)

## 🔥 Overview

Megasynth is a real-time programmable modular synthesizer runtime written in Clojure using [Overtone](https://github.com/overtone/overtone) and SuperCollider (`scsynth`) as the audio engine.

It allows you to define synth patches using a **declarative graph structure**, which is compiled into a **network of interconnected synth nodes**. It supports **polyphonic playback**, **live parameter updates**, and **hot-reloading** of the patch graph with minimal disruption.

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### 🔹 1. Patch Graph (Declarative DSL)

A patch graph should be represented by a single data structure. This should represent modules (oscillators, filters, output etc), knobs (amp, cutoff, res, freq etc) and the connections between all of these components.

Each module represents a synth. The graph is interpreted as a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

---

### 🔹 2. Modules and Ports

Each module is compiled into a `defsynth` (or maybe just `synth`). It receives inputs through control or audio buses, defined via connections in the graph.

A synth's inputs should feed directly from an output bus. There should be no intermediate passthrough synth of any kind.

---

### 🔹 3. Buses

The system allocates **one audio-rate output bus per module** (and optionally control-rate buses for parameters). Bus allocation is **per voice**.

### 🔹 4. Voices

A **voice** is a fully instantiated copy of the entire module graph with its own synths and buses.

* Multiple voices (default: 6–8) support polyphonic playback
* All voices share knobs
* Voices are dynamically instantiated during patch compilation

---

### 🔹 5. Synth Node Evaluation Order

Because SuperCollider’s synthesis node tree is evaluated **in creation order**, synths must be started in **topological sort order** of the graph.

This ensures that when module B consumes the output of module A, A's synth is already running.

---

### 🔹 6. Knobs

Knobs are shared control-rate parameters that can be updated in real time using `(set-knob! :cutoff 0.8)`.

Each knob:

* Allocates a global control-rate bus
* Stores its value
* Supports optional linear or exponential scaling via `:range` and `:scale` metadata

---

### 🔹 7. Patch Compilation

Patch compilation:

1. Allocates buses for each module (per voice)
2. Topologically sorts the module graph
3. Compiles each module into a synth definition (if not done already)
4. Instantiates synths in correct order
5. Binds parameters to bus IDs or knob buses

---

## 🔁 Hot Reloading 

The system should support **hot-swapping the patch graph** with minimal disruption.

This involves:

* **Diffing the old and new graphs**:

  * If module structure is unchanged, reuse existing synths and update buses
  * If modules are added/removed/renamed, only recompile affected nodes
* **Reinstantiating synths** that depend on changed connections or parameters
* **Preserving knob state** and live parameter values during reload

### Approach:

* Keep track of compiled graph state in an atom
* On patch update, compare new and old graphs
* Destroy only the affected voices or modules
* Reconnect everything cleanly

## 🎯 System Goals and Design Philosophy

| Feature                   | Design Intention                                                     |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Modular architecture**  | Each module is isolated, composable, and testable                    |
| **Graph-first logic**     | Patches should feel declarative and visualizable                     |
| **No “router” synths**    | Direct bus mappings only (you don’t want “audio-router” nodes)       |
| **Live control**          | Every parameter should be tweakable in real time                     |
| **REPL-driven**           | All interaction happens via Clojure REPL (for now)                   |
| **Polyphony**             | Designed for expressive keyboard use with chords                     |
| **Performance awareness** | Avoid redundant synth creation; manage voice lifecycles              |
| **Future expandability**  | Support for envelopes, MIDI I/O, sequencer UI, touch interface, etc. |

Ok, this is great, but let's adjust how we're thinking about this.

(ignoring sampling and sequencing for now)
Logically, our DIY synth can be composed of knobs, devices and the output. The user has two forms of input: turning knobs or modifying connections (between knobs->devices, devices->devices and devices->output). 

Knobs could have a value of 0.0 to 1.0 (but would need to be converted by default to usable values in many cases) 

Devices include things like:

- audio oscillators
- low-frequency oscillators
- modulators
- filters
- reverb
- delay
- chorus
- mixers


Each device would have inputs and an output.

For example, an audio oscillator device might actually operate up to three oscillators.

It would have inputs like:
- amplitude
- base frequency
- waveform
- relative note/octave offsets for 2nd and 3rd oscillators
- detune
- portamento

A filter might take inputs:
- input signal (audio signal)
- type (low-pass, high-pass)
- frequency / cutoff
- peak / resonance

A LFO could take inputs:
- frequency
- amplitude
- waveform


In order to setup a configurable tremolo, the user (me) might:

- map knob 1 to lfo0.frequency
- map knob 2 to lfo0.amplitude
- map lfo0.output and knob 0 to the inputs of mixer0
- map mixer0.output to oscillator0.amplitude
- map oscillator0.output to OUT

- adjust knobs 0 and 2 to get the desired average volume and tremolo effect

This composable architecture would be extremely flexible. But, how much of it can Overtone/SuperCollider produce? And how should it be coded?

Does this make sense?
